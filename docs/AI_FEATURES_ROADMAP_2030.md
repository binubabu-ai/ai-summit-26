## 🎯 Core Philosophy
By 2030, documentation becomes a living, intelligent knowledge system that:
- **Self-heals** outdated content before it causes issues
- **Predicts** what developers need before they ask
- **Collaborates** seamlessly with both humans and AI agents
- **Governs** itself while remaining under human control
